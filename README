This project was completed when I was in grade 10 with a classmate. While it doesn't follow a formal structure of released software, it serves as a fun and nostalgic example of my work when I first started programming. This was written in the Turing programming language which is adopted by many Ontario highschools with the purpose of teaching programming to beginners and is no longer being developed.

Instructions:
1. Open “Boxx Final.t” file through Turing IDE
2. Press “Run”, this will launch the game

NOTE: Turing IDE is only available for download on Windows operating system. There are Mac compatible Turning IDE solutions, however they may exhibit weird behavior when running the program.

Enjoy!
